# Uber Switchbacks

This project is based on a [case study of Uber](Uber.pdf), where data on the switchback experiments conducted by Uber are analyzed in order to provide recommendations on whether a 2- or 5-min wait time should be used for the EXPRESS service. 

A full code walkthrough is provided within the [.Rmd file](Uber_case_modeling.Rmd) as comments.

## Dataset

The dataset used within this project is contained within this repo at [619702-XLS-ENG.xlsx - Switchbacks.csv](619702-XLS-ENG.xlsx - Switchbacks.csv). 

It is later preprocessed and the final dataset used in statistical analysis is [modified_uber_data.csv](modified_uber_data.csv).
