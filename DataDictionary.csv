period_start,Date,Start date and time for the 160-minute time period of the current observation. 
wait_time,String,"This variable takes on two possible values: ""2 mins"" if the matching algorithm let riders wait up to 2 minutes during the current time period; ""5 mins"" if the matching algorithm let riders wait up to 5 minutes during the current time period."
treat,Boolean,"This variable takes on two possible values: ""TRUE"" if wait_time equals ""5 mins""; ""FALSE"" if wait_time equals ""2 mins""."
commute,Boolean,"This variable takes on two possible values: ""TRUE"" if the time period happens during rush hours (7-9:40AM or 3-5:40PM), ""FALSE"" otherwise."
trips_pool,Numeric,Total number of POOL trips completed in the current time period. Each matched ride request is a separate trip.
